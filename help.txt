This program should help my mother to submit reports on
the average age of children in her group faster and thus
save a lot of time.

The program reads .xlsx files with a list of students,
where the date of birth (dd.MM.yy format) is in column C and sex in column G.
"М" or "м" for a boy and "Д", "д", "Ж" or "ж" for a girl.

The result of calculations will be the number of boys and
girls distributed by age.
